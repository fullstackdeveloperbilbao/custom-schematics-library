# Description
This schematics allow creating libraries with a name starting with @ and as much nested paths as we want (E.g. @libs/shared/project1/component1). 

It also updates tsconfig.json paths to allow importing the created library in any other library or application (The first / is conserved and others are converted into -):

```
"paths": {
      "@libs/shared-project1-component1": [
        "projects/libs/shared/project1/component1/src/public-api.ts",
      ],
    },
```
